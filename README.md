# Convolution_Neural_Network-prediction_cat-and-dog-
The CNN algorithm was used in the prediction of dog and cat. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle with 25000 training images and 12500 testing images.
The modelling started with the import of necessary packages and followed by the innitialization of the model using Sequential. 
First and second convolution layer was added and this was followed by flattening process. A full connection was done before fitting the model. The ImageDataGenerator was imported and was used in loading the traing and testing dataset.
The classifier was used in the modelling with epoch of 10, step per epoch of 200 and validation step of 500.
Finally the prediction was carried using another sample of dog and cat.
